            <p>
              In 2018, Ash Davis was just another college student scrolling through TikTok. But while everyone else saw
              entertainment, Ash saw opportunity‚Äîand more importantly, saw a problem.
            </p>
            <p className="text-center text-xl font-semibold text-sky-400">
              "Creators were getting screwed, and everyone just accepted it as normal." üíî
            </p>
            <p>
              Traditional talent agencies were taking 20-50% commissions. Creators were locked into contracts that
              favored agencies. Promises were broken. Dreams were crushed. The very people creating the content that
              drove billions in revenue were seeing the smallest slice of the pie.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ash watched talented creators burn out, give up, or worse‚Äîget trapped in exploitative contracts. Something
              had to change.

            <p>
              Instead of complaining, Ash decided to experiment. What if there was a different way? What if an agency
              could succeed by putting creators first?
            </p>
            <div className="bg-black/30 p-6 rounded-2xl border-l-4 border-sky-400">
              <p className="italic">
                "I started with a simple question: What would I want if I were a creator? The answer was obvious‚Äîkeep my

              The first VORTEX creator was actually Ash's roommate, who was struggling to monetize his gaming content.
              Ash helped him optimize his content strategy, connected him with a gaming peripheral brand, and took...
              zero commission.
            </p>
            <p>Within three months, the roommate's income had tripled. Word spread quickly.</p>

            Chapter 3: The Breakthrough
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              By 2020, VORTEX had 50 creators. But Ash faced a critical decision: scale the traditional way (start
              taking commissions) or find a revolutionary approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breakthrough came when Ash realized that TikTok and brands would pay agencies based on creator success
              metrics‚Äînot commissions. This meant VORTEX could be profitable while creators kept 100% of their direct
              earnings.

            <div className="text-center space-y-2">

              <p className="text-cyan-400 font-bold">‚úÖ Everyone wins when creators win</p>
            </div>
            <p>This wasn't just a business model‚Äîit was a philosophy. Success should be shared, not hoarded.</p>

          <div className="space-y-6 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            <p>
              Word about VORTEX spread like wildfire. Creators who had been burned by other agencies found hope. New
              creators found a partner who believed in their potential.
            </p>
            <p>
              But growth brought challenges. How do you maintain personal relationships with thousands of creators? How
              do you scale genuine care?
            </p>
            <p>
              Ash's solution was revolutionary: instead of hiring traditional account managers, VORTEX hired former
              creators who understood the journey. Every VORTEX team member had walked in their creators' shoes.
